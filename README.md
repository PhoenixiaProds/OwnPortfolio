## What is missing?

**Blog part is missing**
- First wanted to include blog part with IT and dev articles.
- Only css written about this part. No html file associated for now.

**Contact form is disabled**
- Also disabled contact form part to avoid spamming when website live.
- Deleted php file, just in case ;)

## What is next?
As this repo was made for a study project, I'm not granting any kind of updates or deadline on it if some are on the run.
Please stay live to be aware of updates.
